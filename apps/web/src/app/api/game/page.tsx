// This file should not exist. API routes are defined in `route.ts` files within their respective directories.
// For example, `/api/game` logic is in `/api/game/route.ts`.
// This file will be removed.

// If you intended to have a browsable page for /api/game, that's not how Next.js API routes work.
// They are endpoints for data, not HTML pages.
